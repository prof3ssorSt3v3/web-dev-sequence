# Sequence for Learning Web Design and Development

This repo contains multiple streams of topics that a web designer and developer should learn.

Each file starts from nothing and walks through a sequence that you can use to logically progress through the subject matter.

It is important to note that there is a lot of overlap between these skill areas. A person would never learn everything in one list without learning a lot in the other lists.
